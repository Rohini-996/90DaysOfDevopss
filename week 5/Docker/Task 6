Explain how Docker volumes help with data persistence and why they are useful
Solution:

🗂️ Docker Volumes & Data Persistence
🚀 What’s the Big Deal About Data Persistence?
When working with Docker containers, by default any data stored inside the container disappears once the container stops, 
crashes, or is removed. That means all your app data, configurations, or database entries would be lost — and that’s not
ideal for real-world applications!

That’s where Docker Volumes come to the rescue. 📦

💡 What Are Docker Volumes?
A Docker Volume is a special storage location outside the container’s filesystem, managed by Docker.
It’s used to store data that needs to persist even if the container is stopped, deleted, or recreated.

Think of it like a separate hard drive that stays safe even if your computer (the container) crashes.

🛠️ Why Use Docker Volumes?
. Here’s why Docker volumes are so useful:
. Data Persistence: Your data sticks around, even when containers don’t.
. Easy Backups: Volumes can be backed up and restored.
. Separation of Concerns: Code lives in the container, data lives in the volume.
. Sharing Across Containers: Multiple containers can access the same volume.
. Performance: Volumes are optimized for I/O and managed efficiently by Docker.

💭 Final Thoughts
Volumes are like your application's memory bank they keep your important stuff safe while Docker does its magic with containers.
Whether you’re building a blog, a database, or an entire app — using volumes is a must if your app handles data.
