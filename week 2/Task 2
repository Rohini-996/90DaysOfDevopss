📁 #Task 2 – Hands-On with Permissions

✅ Goal:
Create a directory devops_workspace and a file project_notes.txt with specific permissions:

Owner: Can edit (read/write)

Group: Can read only

Others: ❌ No access

Steps to Follow:
1️⃣ Create the directory:

mkdir devops_workspace

2️⃣ Create the file inside the directory:

touch devops_workspace/project_notes.txt

3️⃣ Set the correct permissions:

chmod 750 devops_workspace
chmod 640 devops_workspace/project_notes.txt

🔍 What do these permissions mean?
7 (Owner): Read + Write + Execute (rwx)

5 (Group): Read + Execute (r-x) for directory

0 (Others): No permissions (---)

For the file:

6 (Owner): Read + Write (rw-)

4 (Group): Read-only (r--)

0 (Others): No access (---)

✅ Verify with:
ls -l devops_workspace

📄 Expected output:
drwxr-x--- 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 May  4 06:13 devops_workspace
-rw-r----- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    0 May  4 06:13 project_notes.txt

Pro Tip: Setting the right permissions helps secure your system and ensures that only the right people have access. 
A must-know for every DevOps Enginner.
