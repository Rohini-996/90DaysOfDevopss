. Learn about Linux users, groups, and permissions (/etc/passwd, /etc/group).
#Task 1:
. Create a user devops_user and add them to a group devops_team.
. Set a password and grant sudo access.
. Restrict SSH login for certain users in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Create a user devops_user and add them to a group devops_team.
Solution : 
For creating a user in ubuntu (Linux) you have to type a command sudo useradd -m user
-m stands for creating a folder of that particular user
eg : sudo useradd -m devops_user
This will add a user devops_user
For adding devops_user in a group devops_team we have to following command:
sudo usermod -a -G devops_team devopss_user
This will add devops_user to devops_team

. Set a password and grant sudo access.
Solution: 
For setting a password to particular user the command is:
sudo passwd devopss_user
OUTPUT:
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully

. Restrict SSH login for certain users in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
Solution: 
Linux systems manage SSH (Secure Shell) settings through a powerful config file that is /etc/ssh/sshd_config
This file is the core of SSH server settings. It defines who is allowed to remotely access your server and under what condition
Why it matters:
By default, SSH access is open to all users on a system â€” but in a secure environment, not everyone should have remote access.
This simple step helps reduce the attack surface.
For Eg: In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, I added:
AllowUsers devops_user
or to block specific user
DenyUsers testuser tempuser
Then restart ssh by typing 
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Now, Only trusted users can now log in via SSH. This simple step can reduce higher chances of attacks.
