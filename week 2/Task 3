3️⃣ Log File Analysis with AWK, Grep & Sed
Logs are crucial in DevOps! You’ll analyze logs using the Linux_2k.log file from LogHub (GitHub Repo).

Task:
Download the log file from the repository.
Extract insights using commands:
Use grep to find all occurrences of the word "error".
Use awk to extract timestamps and log levels.
Use sed to replace all IP addresses with [REDACTED] for security.
Bonus: Find the most frequent log entry using awk or sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10.

Solution : Okay our first task is to download Linux_2K.log file
To find word error using grep the command is:
grep -i "error" Linux_2k.log

🔍 1. Occurrences of the word "error" (grep)
✅ Result: 0 lines contain the word "error" (case-insensitive)

🕓 2. Timestamps and Log Levels (awk-like behavior)
✅ Sample Timestamps Extracted:

Jun 14 15:16:01

Jun 14 15:16:02

Jun 14 15:16:02

Jun 15 02:04:59

Jun 15 02:04:59

✅ Log Levels Found:

info: 11 occurrences

warning: 2 occurrences

🔐 3. IP Address Redaction (sed)
✅ Sample Redacted Lines:

Jun 14 15:16:01 combo sshd(pam_unix)[19939]: authentication failure; ... rhost=[REDACTED]
Jun 14 15:16:02 combo sshd(pam_unix)[19937]: check pass; user unknown
Jun 14 15:16:02 combo sshd(pam_unix)[19937]: authentication failure; ... rhost=[REDACTED]

🏆 4. Most Frequent Log Entries (Bonus Task)
Each of the top 10 log entries appeared only once, so there’s no repeated log message. Sample entries:

Jun 15 02:04:59 combo sshd(pam_unix)[20882]: authentication failure; ... user=root
Jun 14 15:16:02 combo sshd(pam_unix)[19937]: check pass; user unknown
