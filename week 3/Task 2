# Task 2
Part 2: Account Deletion
Implement an option -d or --delete that allows the script to delete an existing user account. The script should prompt the user to enter the username of the account to be deleted.

Ensure that the script checks whether the username exists before attempting to delete the account. If the username does not exist, display an appropriate message and exit gracefully.

After successfully deleting the account, display a confirmation message with the deleted username

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: With this task i'll be able to know how to delete a user account in SHELL SCRIPT
For deleting a user account in shell script we have to follow the following steps:

Step 1: Prompt for Username

The script starts by asking the user to enter the username of the account they want to delete.

Command: read -p "Enter the username of account to be deleted " username

.....................................................................

 Step 2: Check if the User Exists

 Script: if id $username &>/dev/null; then
            echo "User '$username' exists. Proceeding with deletion...."
         else
            echo "User '$username' does not exist"
            exit 1
         fi  


Explanation: . id $username is used to check whether the user exists on the system.
             . &>/dev/null suppresses any output (success or error).
             . If the command succeeds, it means the user exists, and the script continues.
             . If the command fails, it prints a message saying the user does not exist and exits with code 1, meaning an error occurred.

 Step 3: Delete the User and Their Home Directory

 Command: sudo userdel -r $username

 Explanation: . userdel is the command to delete a user.
              . -r option tells the system to remove the user's home directory and mail spool as well.
              . sudo is used to make sure the command runs with administrative privileges (required to delete users).

 Script: if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "User $username is successfully deleted"
            exit 0
        else
            echo "Failed to delete $username"
            exit 1
        fi
.......................................................................................

Step 4: Confirm Success or Failure

Script: if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
          echo "User $username is successfully deleted"
          exit 0
        else
           echo "Failed to delete $username"
           exit 1
        fi

Explanation: . $? checks the exit status of the previous command (userdel -r).
              . 0 means success.
              . Any other value means the command failed.
              . If deletion was successful:
              . The script prints a success message and exits with code 0.
              . If deletion failed:
              . The script prints an error message and exits with code 1
