Task 1: Working with Pull Requests (PRs)
Scenario: You are working on a new feature and need to merge your changes into the main branch using a Pull Request.

Solution: 

✅ Step-by-Step Guide
1️. Fork & Clone the Repository
First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone it locally:

git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
Tip: You can copy the clone URL from the green “Code” button on your forked repo.

2️. Create a Feature Branch
Always work on a separate branch to keep your main branch clean:
git checkout -b feature-branch
Give your branch a meaningful name (e.g., feature-branch).

3️. Make Your Changes
echo "New Feature" >> feature.txt
Then stage and commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: added a new feature"

4️. Push Your Branch to GitHub
Send your changes to your remote fork:

git push origin feature-branch

5️. Create a Pull Request
Go to your GitHub repo and:

Click “Compare & pull request”

Add a clear title and description

Choose the correct base (usually main) and compare branches

Request a review from a teammate or maintainer

6️. Merge the PR
Once your PR is approved:
Click “Merge Pull Request”


✅ Done!
🎉 You've successfully created and merged a Pull Request!
