ðŸ“˜ Task 5: Rebasing â€“ Keeping a Clean Commit History
Scenario: Your branch is behind the main branch and needs to be updated without extra merge commits.

Solution:
âœ… Step-by-step Instructions
1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote:
   git fetch origin main
   This updates your local reference to origin/main but doesnâ€™t change your working branch yet.

2. Rebase your feature branch onto main:

   git rebase origin/main

   This will reapply your local commits on top of the latest commits from main. It rewrites history so that it looks 
   like you built your work on the latest main.

3. If there are any conflicts during the rebase:

  Resolve the conflicts manually in the affected files.

  After resolving, mark them as resolved:

  git add <file>

4. Then continue the rebase:

git rebase --continue
