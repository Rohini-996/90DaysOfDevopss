# Hands-On with Networking Commands
# Practice essential networking commands like:
. ping (check connectivity)
. traceroute / tracert (trace packet routes)
. netstat (network statistics)
. curl (make HTTP requests)
. dig / nslookup (DNS lookup)
#Task 4: Create a cheat sheet or short guide explaining the purpose and usage of each command.

Solution: The above commands are networking commands

1. ping (check connectivity): Ping command is used to check website connectivity whether a website is running properly or not
ping command is used to check whether data transfer correctly to particular webside or not
e.g = ping youtube.com
PING youtube.com (142.250.192.110) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from bom12s17-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.192.110): icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=75.5 ms
64 bytes from bom12s17-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.192.110): icmp_seq=2 ttl=116 time=129 ms
64 bytes from bom12s17-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.192.110): icmp_seq=3 ttl=116 time=56.6 ms
--- youtube.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2141ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 56.592/86.905/128.575/30.464 ms
The above command show how to ping a particular website
In above example data is successfully tansmitted and received and there is 0 packet loss.
******* As a devops enjinner we need to ping websites daily to check connectivity or data is succesfully sent and receive ********

2. netstat (network statistics)
For netstat command we have to install net-tools, the command is
. sudo apt-get install net-tools
. netstat stands for network statistics
. netstat command is used to show active internet connection on your system
e.g netstat
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      1 172.23.17.64:35438      ec2-54-217-10-153:https SYN_SENT
Active UNIX domain sockets (w/o servers)
Proto RefCnt Flags       Type       State         I-Node   Path

unix  3      [ ]         DGRAM      CONNECTED     1080     /run/systemd/notify
unix  2      [ ]         DGRAM                    1094     /run/systemd/journal/syslog
unix  7      [ ]         DGRAM      CONNECTED     1096     /run/systemd/journal/dev-log
unix  8      [ ]         DGRAM      CONNECTED     1098     /run/systemd/journal/socket
unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     19712    @dca604012932c761/bus/systemd-timesyn/bus-api-timesync

unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     1351     @634233a62a02f079/bus/systemd/bus-api-system
unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     22697    @3c6d6b7317b0b00/bus/systemd-resolve/bus-api-resolve

unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     22264    /run/dbus/system_bus_socket
unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     20565    /run/systemd/journal/stdout
unix  3      [ ]         DGRAM      CONNECTED     196

The above command shows how netsat command is working 

3. traceroute
For traceroute command we have to install traceroute, the command is
. sudo apt-get install traceroute
. traceroute command determines the path a packet take to reach a destination by following ip addresses
. e.g traceroute youtube.com
traceroute to youtube.com (142.250.192.78), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  LAPTOP-6F2K1CME.mshome.net (172.23.16.1)  0.667 ms  0.621 ms  0.606 ms
 2  192.168.83.190 (192.168.83.190)  10.217 ms  10.165 ms  10.148 ms
 3  106.200.139.225 (106.200.139.225)  65.108 ms  66.413 ms  67.383 ms

 9  72.14.237.10 (72.14.237.10)  54.958 ms 209.85.240.54 (209.85.240.54)  46.327 ms 142.250.214.100 (142.250.214.100)  72.205 ms

In above example traceroute command show how source reaches destination through ip addresses 

4. curl (make HTTP requests)
The curl command lets you send or fetch data from an endpoint using different HTTP methods:
GET – the default method that fetches data from the server. POST – sends data to the endpoint. PUT – creates a resource on the endpoint or updates an existing one
e.g  curl -X GET https://api.restful-api.dev/objects
[{"id":"1","name":"Google Pixel 6 Pro","data":{"color":"Cloudy White","capacity":"128 GB"}},{"id":"2","name":"Apple iPhone 12 Mini, 256GB, Blue","data":null},
{"id":"3","name":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max","data":{"color":"Cloudy White","capacity GB":512}},{"id":"4","name":"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB","data":{"price":389.99,"color":"Purple"}},
{"id":"5","name":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2","data":{"price":689.99,"color":"Brown"}},{"id":"6","name":"Apple AirPods","data":{"generation":"3rd","price":120}},{"id":"7","name":"Apple MacBook Pro 16","data":{"year":2019,"price":1849.99,"CPU model":"Intel Core i9","Hard disk size":"1 TB"}},{"id":"8","name":"Apple Watch Series 8","data":{"Strap Colour":"Elderberry","Case Size":"41mm"}},{"id":"9","name":"Beats Studio3 Wireless","data":{"Color":"Red","Description":"High-performance wireless noise cancelling headphones"}},{"id":"10","name":"Apple iPad Mini 5th Gen","data":{"Capacity":"64 GB","Screen size":7.9}},{"id":"11","name":"Apple iPad Mini 5th Gen","data":{"Capacity":"254 GB","Screen size":7.9}},{"id":"12","name":"Apple iPad Air","data"
:{"Generation":"4th","Price":"419.99","Capacity":"64 GB"}},{"id":"13","name":"Apple iPad Air","data":{"Generation":"4th","Price":"519.99","Capacity":"256 GB"}}]

In above command curl fetch the data of an api which is of phone

5.  dig / nslookup (DNS lookup)
. The dig command is a command-line tool that queries the Domain Name System (DNS).
. It can be used to troubleshoot network and domain issues, and perform other DNS operations.
e.g dig youtube.com
; <<>> DiG 9.18.30-0ubuntu0.24.04.2-Ubuntu <<>> youtube.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 9207
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1280
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;youtube.com.                   IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
youtube.com.            282     IN      A       142.251.42.78

;; Query time: 70 msec
;; SERVER: 10.255.255.254#53(10.255.255.254) (UDP)

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 56

In above command show dig query for youtube.com successfully returned the IP address 142.251.42.78 with a TTL of 282 seconds.
The query took 70 milliseconds and was processed by the DNS server at 10.255.255.254.

so, here is a cheatsheet of some basic to intermediate networking commands.
