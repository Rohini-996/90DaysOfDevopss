#Task 1: Write examples of how each layer applies to real-world scenarios (e.g., HTTP at the Application Layer, TCP at the Transport Layer).

1. Application Layer (Layer 7):
Example: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

Real-World Scenario: When you visit a website, your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) uses HTTP to request web pages from a server. 
This layer makes sure your web browser can talk to the server and get the content you want, like images or text.

Example in Action: Typing a website address (URL) into your browser and loading a page is the Application Layer working.

2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
Example: SSL/TLS (Encryption)

Real-World Scenario: When you shop online, SSL/TLS encrypts your payment information to keep it safe. The Presentation Layer 
ensures the data is secure and understandable by both sides of the communication, even if it's encrypted.

Example in Action: When you're making an online purchase, SSL/TLS keeps your sensitive data (like credit card details) secure while being transmitted.

3. Session Layer (Layer 5):
Example: NetBIOS or Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

Real-World Scenario: This layer keeps the communication between two devices active, like during a video call or an online gaming session.
It ensures that your session stays open, so you can keep chatting, playing, or browsing without interruptions.

Example in Action: During a Zoom meeting, the Session Layer keeps the connection live as you talk with others.

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):
Example: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Real-World Scenario: When you send an email, TCP makes sure the message is properly broken into smaller pieces, sent, and then
reassembled in the right order when it reaches its destination. It also makes sure none of the pieces get lost along the way.

Example in Action: Streaming a video on YouTube, where TCP ensures that video data arrives smoothly and in the correct order, so you can watch it without interruptions.

5. Network Layer (Layer 3):
Example: IP (Internet Protocol)

Real-World Scenario: This layer is in charge of figuring out how to send data from one place to another across different networks. For example,
when you send an email, the Network Layer ensures your data is routed to the correct server, no matter how many routers it passes through.

Example in Action: Sending an email from your smartphone, where the Network Layer helps route the data to the correct destination across the internet.

6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
Example: Ethernet, Wi-Fi

Real-World Scenario: This layer ensures that data gets from your device to the local network (like your router). It’s responsible for addressing your
device with unique identifiers (like a MAC address) and making sure data can travel over physical connections like Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables.

Example in Action: Connecting to Wi-Fi at home—your laptop or phone uses the Data Link Layer to establish communication with the router via its MAC address.

7. Physical Layer (Layer 1):
Example: Ethernet Cables, Fiber Optic Cables, Wi-Fi Signals

Real-World Scenario: The Physical Layer is about the actual hardware—wires, cables, or radio signals—that carry data. It’s like the “highway” that 
data travels on. For example, it turns data into electrical signals to be sent through cables or wireless signals.

Example in Action: Using a cable to connect your computer to the internet, or using Wi-Fi to connect wirelessly, the Physical Layer ensures the data is physically sent over the correct medium.
