#Task 5: Advanced Branching and Switching
Solution: 

✅1. Create a New Branch
First, you create a new branch called feature-update. A branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes
without affecting the main project.

Command: git checkout -b feature-update
Switch to the New Branch
Next, you switch your working area to that new branch so you can start making changes there.

✅2. git checkout feature-update
Modify the File and Commit Changes
Now, edit the file info.txt — maybe add more details or improve its content. After making your changes:

e.g echo "Hello I am in feature branch" > info.txt
Stage the file:
git add info.txt
Commit the changes with a clear message describing what you did:
msg = git commit -m "Feature update: Enhance info.txt with additional details"

✅3. Push the Branch to GitHub
Upload your branch and changes to the remote repository on GitHub:

git push origin feature-update
Merge via Pull Request
Finally, open a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your changes from feature-update into the main branch. 
This lets others review your work before it becomes part of the main project.
