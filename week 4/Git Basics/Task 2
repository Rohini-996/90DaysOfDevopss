#Task 2: Initialize a Local Repository and Create a File

Solution:
Step 1: Creating My Challenge Workspace
I started by setting up a new directory inside my cloned repository:

Command: mkdir week-4-challenge
Change Directory: cd week-4-challenge

Step 2: Initializing a Git Repository
Version control begins here! I initialized the folder as a Git repository:

Command: git init
This turns the folder into a trackable project where every change can be monitored. Itâ€™s like giving your project memory! ðŸ§ 

Step 3: Creating the First File
I created a simple text file with some introduction:

echo "My name is Rohini and I want to be a successful Devops Enginner" > info.txt
This was just a basic intro file, but it's a great to start practicing Git operations.

Step 4: Staging and Committing

Time to track the changes:
git add info.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add info.txt with introductory content"
âœ… Staging means preparing the file for commit.
âœ… Committing saves the fileâ€™s current state with a message â€“ like a journal entry for your code!

And that's it you are good to go with staging, tracking and commiting on git
